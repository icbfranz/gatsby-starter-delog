    "description": "<p>Let's solve environmental problems with technology! Join me in exploring possible solutions to complex environmental problems while covering the advantages and disadvantages of certain technologies. From AI to energy this portfolio will dive into everything tech. But I just won't be telling you about certain technologies, instead my goal is to come with realistic solutions to real problems.</p>\n<h1>About the Author</h1>\n<img scr=https://ictoxlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/circle-cropped.png alt=\"Bruce Franz\">\n<p>Bruce Franz is a senior at IC earning a B.S in Environmental Science and he is working on a self-designed study labeled Computational Environmental Health. The lab has given him the opportunity to study Raman Mass Spectroscopy to ensure particles found in samples are actually plastic. He is also the lead developer of ictoxlab.com. While not working in the lab Bruce enjoys hikes, a mean cup of coffee from Gimmie! Coffee, and loves to camp. After graduation he will be a Master of Public Health student studying environmental and occupational health at Oregon State University.</p>"
