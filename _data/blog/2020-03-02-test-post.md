In this artifact I plan to dive into what AI is and it how it could possibly be used in an environmental context. AI is complex system so this artifact will be a blog type post that explores different situations where AI could be applied. I plan to do a search for peer reviewed articles to get a better idea of what AI is being used for, then come up with my own thoughts and ideas to see what I think could be done to help reduce the effects of climate change. 

This is a great grey literature source: [Artificial Intelligenceâ€”A Game Changer for Climate Change and the Environment](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/06/05/artificial-intelligence-climate-environment/). 



I think that this project will take 5 hours.
