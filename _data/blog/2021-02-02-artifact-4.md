I plan to use Sawyer to build a program that solves an environmental problem. I am going to use the builder in tools the Sawyer application along with the Sawyer SDK. At this point I am not sure what application I am going to use but I have a couple of ideas floating around. I also plan to use Sawyer's camera system to it can visually recognize an object and move it but making sure the problem it is solving is related to the environment. 

I plan to use the docs that are available on the Sawyer website. 

This project will take 10 hours to complete.
