I have started to use Sawyer to complete this artifact. I plan to make Sawyer sort objects based on recycling code. 

I have started to build the program in Intera, it will use the cameras to recognize the objects and identify if it can be recycled or not. I will have to configure the gripper arm again to make the gripper function correctly.
