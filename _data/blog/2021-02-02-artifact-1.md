I plan to design an alternative water filter in SketchUp. Most of the time water delivery is a problem when it comes to simple but effective water filtration system for developing countries. I am interested in pursuing this project as I want to learn more about CAD and to improve upon already existing water filtration devices. The goal of this project it to come up with a cost efficient but effective method for providing water to communities in need. The projects meets the criteria outlined because it will expose me to topic areas that I have never really explored before.  



I believe that this project will take 10 hours. As I have never used CAD before.
