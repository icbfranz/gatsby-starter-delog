I have started to work on my water filter. I am still in the very early learning stage of learning Fusion 360, a CAD program for 3D design. I plan to have solar panels and pumps that push water through filters from a collection tank. So far I have designed the collection tank (see image). There's lots left to do! 

The next steps are learning how to modify shapes within Fusion 360.
