In my final artifact I plan to interview someone from the energy industry and ask them questions about the future energy. For example: how will the energy industry make the transition from fossil fuels to sustainable types of energy. I will also want to know what techs are involved to make the change possible. I think it will also bring together some of the other technologies mentioned in this portfolio such as AI.  

I plan to interview someone from NRG. 

I think this will take 3 hours to complete.
